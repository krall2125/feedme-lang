# feedme-lang
It is no more an esoteric programming language.
It is written in Zig. I really needed to fix the memory leaks in the C version, but maintaining it was just impossible. This is why I am completely remastering the idea and making it in Zig.

The source code is scrapped from another project of mine which was a stack based language.
I do not plan to complete that project any time soon. I need to focus on my git projects.

# Why Zig?
Fast and more memory safe than C.
It can detect leaks and I don't have to use some fancy debugging tool like valgrind.
C is still a great language, but I can see that Zig is worth learning.
